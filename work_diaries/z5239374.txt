Week 1
I joined in a team for the project, I proposed that everyone should not rush but to gather resources for the first week.
I was assigned to work on the frontend cause I'm the only one that has some frontend background.
I had some researches about react.js and material ui, which are the two main libraries I'm going to use for the frontend.
I made a simple login page and partially the main page.

Week 2
One of our team members dropped the course, we are a ground of 4 now.
we had a meeting about the proposal, assigned jobs to everyone, I was mainly responsible for the system architechture.

Week 3
A new member joined our team, but he seems to have some troubles getting in. I worked with other teammates together on users stories and system 
architecture for our proposal. I also installed a virtually machine, and tested our only frontend in the new environment, it works fine. We will start to 
work on the actual project soon.
