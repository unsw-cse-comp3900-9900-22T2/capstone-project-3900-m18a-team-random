Week 1
I joined in a team for the project, I proposed that everyone should not rush but to gather resources for the first week.
I was assigned to work on the frontend cause I'm the only one that has some frontend background.
I had some researches about react.js and material ui, which are the two main libraries I'm going to use for the frontend.
I made a simple login page and partially the main page.

Week 2
One of our team members dropped the course, we are a ground of 4 now.
we had a meeting about the proposal, assigned jobs to everyone, I was mainly responsible for the system architechture.
