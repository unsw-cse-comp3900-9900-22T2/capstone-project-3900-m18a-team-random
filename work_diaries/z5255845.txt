Week 1
Set up Jira and discussed with everyone what project to do.

Week 2
Set up GitHub classroom and discussed which parts of the project to allocate to each team member and got started on the project proposal.

Week 3 
Consolidated everyone's contributions for the project proposal, added my own revisions and completed and submitted the project proposal.

Week 4
I completed the user authentication implementation for the backend and finished our first user story.

Week 5
We completed our lab demonstration for Sprint 1, and I wrote up the Retrospective A report.
Then, since our existing backend structure was quite confusing and not very maintainable, I 
did some major refactoring to make the project easier to maintain and work with. 

Then, I redid the backend implementation from scratch as the old one was not very maintainable. The old version contained two python files for each feature, e.g. UserProfile, TaskBoard, etc.; however,
this made things too confusing and complicated when adding new features. 
I also added new implementations, including:
- User authentication + JW Tokens 
- Task functionality 
- Team functionality 
- Comment functionality 
- Password reset functionality

Week 6 
Flexi-week. Continued working on Sprint 2 user stories.

Week 7
Continued working on Sprint 2 user stories.

Week 8
We completed our lab demo for Progression Check B, and I wrote up the Retrospective B report.

Week 9
Continued working on Sprint 3 user stories.

Week 10
I added the logout and reset password functionalities in both frontend and backend. 
We did the final demonstration and I talked about the user authentication system.
I then wrote up the entire Project Report except for the user guide.
I also submitted the final code.
