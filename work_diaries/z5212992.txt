Week 1
Set up Jira and discussed with everyone what project to do.


Week 2
In last week, I set up our projectâ€™s programing environment, including Jira, discussed our project topics with my teammates and we decided to do project 4(Task Manager System). I plan to finish the background of our project proposal and half of  the UI design by next week.
