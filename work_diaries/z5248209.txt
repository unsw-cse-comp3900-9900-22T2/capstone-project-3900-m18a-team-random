week1

I joined this team along with one of my friends, we are divided into subgroups with 2 people working on frontend and 2 people working on backend, I
took frontend, I set up an account for jira and linked it to github, I was assigned to come up with 2 objectives

week2

we assign tasks to everyone and scheduled another meeting, I was assigned to complete product backlog and inital sprint backlog,
I also spent some time self-study rontend with materials Zhen has sent me with, because I had no experience with frontend. I organized the blacklog and created
3 sprints on jira to make it obvious for everyone else to add thier own user stories in.

week3
we had two meetings with the group this week finalizing the group proposal, I finished the product backlog and put
all the user stories on jira, I also disscussed with the team which stories should be put in the initial sprint
