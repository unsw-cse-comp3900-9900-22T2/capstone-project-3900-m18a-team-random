week1

I joined this team along with one of my friends, we are divided into subgroups with 2 people working on frontend and 2 people working on backend, I
took frontend, I set up an account for jira and linked it to github, I was assigned to come up with 2 objectives

week2

we assign tasks to everyone and scheduled another meeting, I was assigned to complete product backlog and inital sprint backlog,
I also spent some time self-study rontend with materials Zhen has sent me with, because I had no experience with frontend. I organized the blacklog and created
3 sprints on jira to make it obvious for everyone else to add thier own user stories in.

week3
we had two meetings with the group this week finalizing the group proposal, I finished the product backlog and put
all the user stories on jira, I also disscussed with the team which stories should be put in the initial sprint
I watched some crash courses of Js react framework on Youtube 

week4
I was assigned to do backend as now Zhen took our frontend, Barry helped me set up the envirment on virtual machine and taught me all the logics and the code he wrote
back then, he built the prototype all by himself, I did not do much this week rather than understanding the code

week5
I successfully implemeted some backend features in our user story, I implemented some features and APIs such as update task, delete task and so on base on the APIs from 
the data access layer, I successfully ran the frontend and backend, with the help from my team, we connect frontend and backend together, I was chosen to demo


week6

I did not do much in week6 as I was working on another assignment, Zhen, Barry and Justin held a meeting, I am glad that our new member Mingfei contributed to the progress of our project
